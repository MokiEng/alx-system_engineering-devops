**Sample REST API - Short README**

# Sample REST API

The Sample REST API is a lightweight and easy-to-use web service that provides endpoints for managing a collection of books. It follows the principles of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on book resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask web framework
- SQLite (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sample-rest-api.git
cd sample-rest-api
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the database (SQLite):

```
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

### Usage

1. Start the server:

```
flask run
```

2. Access the API at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

- Method: GET
- Description: Get details of a specific book.
- Response: JSON object representing the book.

### Create a New Book

- Endpoint: `/books`
- Method: POST
- Description: Create a new book.
- Request body: JSON object containing book details (title, author, etc.).
- Response: JSON object representing the newly created book.

### Update a Book

- Endpoint: `/books/<int:book_id>`
- Method: PUT

## Error Handling

- The API provides informative error responses for invalid requests or server errors.
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages are returned to help troubleshoot issues.

## Authentication (Optional)

- The API supports token-based authentication to secure sensitive endpoints.
- Obtain an access token by sending a POST request with credentials to `/login`.
- Include the access token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

## Conclusion

The Sample REST API provides a straightforward way to manage a collection of books through HTTP endpoints. It's a great starting point for learning about RESTful architecture, Flask, and building APIs in Python. Feel free to explore the code, customize the API, and integrate it with your projects!
