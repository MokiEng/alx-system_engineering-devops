**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:**  Shockingly  [02:00] to Astonishingly [04:30] (UTC)
- **Impact:** A jolting electric power outage struck [[Addis Ababa/Ethiopia]], leaving [85]% of residents and businesses powerless. Fridges turned into igloos, Wi-Fi signals vanished, and candlelit dinners made an unexpected comeback.

**Timeline:**
- **[02:00]:** Suddenly, devices went dark, alarms blared, and the symphony of silence set in. A city-wide power outage was detected when the phones lit up with furious tweets about missing cat videos.
- ** [02:05]:** Engineers stumbled upon this electrifying issue while sipping their morning coffee, promptly choking on it.
- ** [02:20]:** The adventure began with an inspection of power distribution networks and substations by our brave power rangers.
- **[02:30]:** Initial diagnosis pointed fingers at a mischievous squirrel that tried to turn the power lines into a tightrope.
- **[02:35]:** The case took a wild twist as engineers realized it was not a squirrel but a series of power line failures due to an unforeseen equipment glitch.
- **[[02:45]:** Technical wizards joined forces to tackle this digital blackout, using their magic wands (read: tools) and incantations (read: code).
- **[03:25]:** Escalation ensued, as engineers called upon the High Council of Electricity to assemble and dispel the dark forces.
- **[03:35]:** The out-of-order power lines were rebooted, given a stern talking to, and sent on their way to illuminate the city once again.
- **[04:15]:** Finally, lights flickered and devices hummed back to life, bringing an end to the unexpected "Lights Out" movie marathon.
- **[04:30]:** With a triumphant "zap," the power grid was resurrected, and cheers resounded through [Addis Ababa/Ethiopia].

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The culprit behind the power outage? Gremlins? Mischievous imps? Nope, it was an equipment glitch that played havoc with the power lines' perfect symphony. Our engineers wielded their trusty toolkits and conducted power line CPR, bringing them back from the brink and restoring harmony to the grid.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
1. **Gremlin-Proofing:** Institute regular equipment checks to keep mischievous gremlins and glitches at bay.
2. **Backup Brigade:** Enhance backup power systems, ensuring that power grid heroes are always ready to leap into action.
3. **Magic Maintenance:** Regularly inspect and maintain power distribution infrastructure to catch potential problems before they cause chaos.
4. **Surge Protectors:** Implement robust surge protection systems to shield equipment from unexpected glitches and voltage spikes.
5. **Transparency Spell:** Develop clear communication plans to keep citizens informed, minus the mystery and suspense.

**Conclusion:**
Our electric power outage saga reminds us that even in the darkest moments, engineers shine as beacons of light. Through determination, technical prowess, and a dash of humor, we navigated the abyss and restored the power that fuels our daily lives. As we bask in the comforting glow of well-lit rooms, let's remember that every flicker of resilience and every spark of teamwork can brighten even the darkest of times. So, here's to facing the "shocking" challenges that life throws our way and emerging stronger, brighter, and ready for the next electrifying adventure!
