When you type "google.com" in your browser's address bar and press Enter, several things happen:

1. DNS Resolution: The browser first checks its cache to see if it already has the IP address associated with "google.com". If not, it sends a request to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address.

2. Establishing a Connection: Once the browser has obtained the IP address for "google.com", it establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server at that IP address. This connection is done using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol, depending on whether the website supports secure communication.

3. Sending a Request: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, specifically to the default HTTP port (80) or the default HTTPS port (443) if it's an HTTPS connection. The request typically includes information like the requested resource (in this case, the homepage), headers, and other relevant details.

4. Server Processing: The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. In the case of "google.com," the server will look for the requested resource (the homepage) and generate an appropriate response.

5. Server Response: The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser. The response includes an HTTP status code indicating whether the request was successful (e.g., 200 OK) or encountered an error (e.g., 404 Not Found). The response also contains the requested resource (the HTML content of the Google homepage) and other relevant information like headers.

6. Rendering the Page: The browser receives the server's response and starts rendering the HTML content received. It parses the HTML, applies any associated CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles, executes JavaScript code (if present), and renders the page accordingly. The result is the Google homepage being displayed in the browser window.

7. Additional Requests: The rendered page may contain additional resources referenced by the HTML, such as images, CSS files, or JavaScript files. The browser sends separate requests for these resources to the appropriate URLs to retrieve them.

8. Displaying the Complete Page: As the browser receives the additional resources, it integrates them into the rendered page. Once all the necessary resources are loaded, the complete Google homepage is displayed in the browser window, ready for user interaction.

This process may vary slightly depending on factors like browser settings, caching mechanisms, website optimizations, and network conditions, but the general sequence of steps remains similar.
